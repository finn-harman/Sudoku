Summarise your findings here (see specification).

To identify each of the mystery puzzles, I counted the number of times
my recursive 'solve_board' function was called to solve each of the
sudokus. In the case of the impossible sudoku, I found the sudoku for
which the 'solve_board' function returned false.

My results were:
Easy board: 2172 calls
Medium board: 15662 calls
Hard board (mystery3.dat): 25667 calls
Very hard board (mystery1.dat): 421547 calls
Impossible board (mystery2.dat)

I chose to use recursive calls as my measure of complexity as it will
be the same on any machine. Recording time taken to
solve each sudoku would vary between machines, although the order of
time taken would be the same across machines. By measuring number of
calls, we get a better idea of the mechanics of the recursive function.
